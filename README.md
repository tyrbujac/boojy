## FAQ

**Q: When can I download the apps?**  
A: Preview testing starts Month 2 (closed, 10-20 testers). Public beta launches Month 5+ (starting with Audio).

**Q: Will Boojy always be free?**  
A: Yes. Every app is free forever. Optional Boojy Cloud subscriptions support development.

**Q: Can I use Boojy for commercial work?**  
A: Absolutely! No licensing fees, no restrictions. Use for client work, freelancing, business projects.

**Q: When will apps be open-source?**  
A: After each app reaches v1.0 stability (feature-complete + stable). Audio v1.0 expected Month 15+.

**Q: How is Boojy different from Adobe?**
A: Free (no £798/year subscription), privacy-first (opt-out telemetry), open-source (after v1.0), no generative AI (respects human creativity).

**Q: Does Boojy collect any data?**
A: Apps collect anonymous usage data (crash reports, feature usage, performance metrics) to improve quality. This is opt-out - disable anytime in Settings → Privacy. We can't identify individual users. See [Privacy Policy](https://boojy.org/privacy.html) for details.

**Q: Does Boojy have generative AI?**
A: No. Boojy apps do not include AI image generation or AI fill tools. AI helps *build* the software (coding assistance), but doesn't touch *your* creative work.
